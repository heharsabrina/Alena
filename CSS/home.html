   <p >Alena is about connecting people to facilities for transportation in India. Since, people use buses on a daily bases in India and are struggling to travel as they do not know the timings. This is where we come in, we notify the people when the buses will arrive near their stop. Also, we inform the passengers where the buses are at a given time so people can track their buses. People who want to travel inter-district/state can book their tickets online, they will know where their bus is and be ready when the buses are arriving to their destinations.</p>
   <p>We are trying to help people reach places on time. People can use the site to know which bus goes where so that they can use the bus for their benefit. The site also helps people get to know the shortest distance to their destinations so the passengers don't waste their time searching and waiting for the bus. We trying to save the time of our customers who want to travel places or want to be at places on time. We are informing the bus timings to people who are unaware of the timings.</p>
